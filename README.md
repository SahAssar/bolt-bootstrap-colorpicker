Bootstrap colorpicker
======================

A replacement for the colorpicker extension that no longer seems to work. Based on http://mjolnic.com/bootstrap-colorpicker/ and Raistlfiren/FAIconFieldType

Field Usage 

    color:
        type: bootstrapcolorpicker

Supported options:

    color:
        type: bootstrapcolorpicker
        component: true
        format: inline
        hidden: true
        horizontal: true
        inline: true
        align: right

Extension icon (color wheel) by Aha-Soft from the Noun Project. Color added (badly) to the icon by me.
